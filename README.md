# Weather App

The following is a weather application built with React, which shows a five-day weather forecast for a city which a user can search for.  It utilises dynamic data from a weather API created by Command Shift, and fetches said data using Axios.  It also utilises: components, props, as well as the useState and useEffect hooks.

## Features

The App displays a five-day weather forecast for a named city/town.  It displays the date, current temperature, humidity, wind-speed and wind-direction.  It also allows for a more detailed element to be rendered for a particular date when clicked on.
